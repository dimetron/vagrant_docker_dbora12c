Command Line Variables Usage
  Command line variables are specified using <name=value>; for example:
    [ session: | compName: | compName:version: ]variableName=" valueOfVariable"]

   Session/Installer variables are specified using:
          [session:]varName=value
    Ex 1: session:ORACLE_HOME_NAME="OraHome"
    Ex 2: ORACLE_HOME_NAME="OraHome"
    The lookup order is session:varName then just varName. The session prefix is used to avoid ambiguity.

   Component variables are specified using:
          [compInternalName:[Version:]]varName
    Ex 1: oracle.comp1:1.0.1:varName="VarValue"
    Ex 2: oracle.comp1:varName="VarValue"
    The lookup order is compInternalName:Version:varName, then compInternalName:varName, then just varName.
